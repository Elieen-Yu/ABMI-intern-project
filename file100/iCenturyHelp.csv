XEFCLTEF,1,1,1,,"Modifiyer for cultivation enhancement of decomposition -- makes the cultivation effect weather/month independent.  If the parameter is ommitted or the value is zero the original Century 4.0 model is executed. If the value is non-zero the new algorithm is run. The value of this parameter is the half life (months) for this decomposition enhancement. CO2 evolution studies indicate that there are significant increases in decomposition for 2-4 weeks after a soil disturbance. So that parameter should be on the order of 1.\nIf the parameter is set to values eqt or grt 3 then the decomposition enhancement will be small in any given month but will extend over most of the growing season. This should be avoided since it tends to run the effect of one cultivation to the next, causing uncertainty in the additive effects.\nUsing a value of 1, Century predicts nominal decreases in SOM levels depending on the dates and characteristics of the cultivation events."
